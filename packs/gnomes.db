However, there is truth behind the stories, for Gnomes are not only real, but they live in the Empire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gnomes &mdash; or <em>Gnommi</em> as they call themselves in their native tongue of <em>Ghassally</em> &mdash; have a handful of settlements within the Empire&rsquo;s borders, but do not mix with the broader Human population to any significant degree. So uncommon are they, Gnomes are often mistaken for overthin Halflings by ill-educated folk.</p>\n<p>Because of this, Gnomes seeking unquestioned passage through the Empire often shave any facial hair and wear bulky clothes or padding to hide their far thinner frames. Whilst this would never fool a Halfling, it is usually enough to convince others.</p>\n<p>Short, wiry, with bulbous noses, and large, rounded ears, Gnomes have thick hair, dextrous fingers, and gruff voices that can be surprisingly deep for such diminutive folk. They are a close-knit, clannish people, putting family and personal loyalty ahead of most other concerns with a stubborn tenacity that can surprise even the most intractable Dwarf. Much as the legends suggest, Gnomes are inherently magical, and share a close relationship with Ulgu, the magical wind of shadows, illusions, and deceit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Glimdwarrow is the largest Gnome settlement within the Empire, though rumours claim others lie beneath the Grey Mountains in Reikland, the Middle Mountains in Middenland, and the K&ouml;lsa Hills of Talabecland. Glimdwarrow itself lies hidden below the Mirror Moors to the south of Middenland, its burrows and halls cloaked by powerful illusions and vigilantly guarded by the Dwarrow Guard, an elite unit of warrior-wizards. Glimdwarrow once boasted a bustling population of many thousands, but a century ago the Greenskin hordes of Grom the Paunch swept through the Mirror Moors and massacred almost all the Gnomes hiding there. Today, Glimdwarrow&rsquo;s crumbling chambers are largely empty, and only eight Gnome clans survive. Ruled by troubled Merawidda Frayne, the Ashen Queen, the leaders of the remaining clans openly hate each other, each blaming the others for the horrors Grom&rsquo;s Greenskins unleashed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opinions</h3>\n<p><strong>On Dwarfs&hellip;</strong></p>\n<blockquote>&lsquo;Great Mother Tegen thinks she&rsquo;s stubborn, always talking about &rsquo;ow it were Clan Landweth that caused all our problems, and &rsquo;ow she won&rsquo;t be persuaded otherwise. But, as Mabyn is me witness, she ain&rsquo;t got nothing on they Dwarfs. I&rsquo;ve seen mountains more moveable when it comes to matters of gold.&rsquo;</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&ndash; Aelyn Thorne, Glimdwarrow Trader</p>\n<p><strong>On Wood Elves&hellip;</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t ever met them, and I doubts I ever will. Probably no better than them other hoity-toity Elves from across the water.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&ndash; Morkam &lsquo;Kneebone&rsquo;, Mirror Moor Farmer</p>\n<p><strong>On High Elves&hellip;</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo; &rsquo;Ere, after 200 years, I&rsquo;m still jumping mad at them Elves. If it &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t been for they idiots, we&rsquo;d still be accepted across the Empire. But, no, it&rsquo;s their way or nothing, and sadly that Emperor Magnus listened to those bloody Elves about what magic is. So, here we are, &rsquo;iding away, jumping at shadows.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&ndash; Kywere Hawken, Glimdwarrow Illusionist</p>\n<p><strong>On Halflings&hellip;</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;Little hellers, they are! Met a family of them on the road travelling to Nomenfast, and while one was making a good deal to me face for a tray of pins, the rest were in me wares attempting to half-inch all me gear. Ringol&rsquo;s Beard, I bet they got a shock when they got back to camp and found themselves light of their purses&hellip;&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&ndash; Durngarth Peddlar, Wandering Vagabond</p>\n<p><strong>On Humans&hellip;</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&lsquo;If it ain&rsquo;t their witch hunters chasing us for whatevers, or their lords looking to muscle us out, it&rsquo;s their traders looking to steal what&rsquo;s ours. But, they&rsquo;s our neighbours, so they are, so we &rsquo;ave to make do somehow. Best to keep our heads low, I says. Real low.&rsquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&ndash; Old Demelza &lsquo;Crowfeet&rsquo;, Mirror Moor Fishwife</p>\n<p><strong>On Ogres&hellip;</strong></p>\n<blockquote>&lsquo;So, she says to me, &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t much eating on you, eh?&rdquo; Didn&rsquo;t bloody stop &rsquo;er trying though! Chased me across the moor, she did. For two days! Bloody wouldn&rsquo;t give up! Never met an Ogre that didn&rsquo;t look at me the way I look at a Rumster&rsquo;s pie, so I runs whenever I see &rsquo;un of they idiots. Safest that way.&rsquo;</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&ndash; Jowanet Scantleburn, Herbalist of the Midden Marshes</p>\n<h2>Gnome Characters</h2>\n<h3>Sidebar: Moorfolk</h3>\n<p>In the duchies bordering the Mirror Moors and nearby the Midden Marshes, Gnomes are relatively well known as they are often found abroad as entertainers, wandering pedlars, or merchants. Locally, they are known as &lsquo;Moorfolk&rsquo;, a secretive people with untrusting natures who fish the Midden Marshes. Rumours of Moorfolk practicing forbidden magics are common, which attracts witch hunters to the region in significant numbers, though few find anything more than open moors and the dangerous local fauna, including River Trolls, Fen&nbsp;Worms, and Bog Octopuses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Gnome Wizards</h3>\n<p>Gnomes can only learn the Lore of Shadows, Dark Magic, and Chaos Magic. Like Wood Elves, some Gnome wizards study Dark Magic, which results in significant interest from witch hunters; however, they recognise its dangers, and have outlawed Necromancy and Daemonology. Using Chaos Magic of any kind is strictly forbidden.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Skills and Talents</h3>\n<p>Like other Species, it is assumed that all Gnomes in the Empire are fluent in Reikspiel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All Gnomes are considered to be at least a little magical, so if they take the Language (Magick) Skill, they can attempt Dispelling, as described on page 237 of WFRP, even if they have no Talents that allow them to cast spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Gnome Names</h3>\n<p>Gnomes usually have a forename and a clan name, though those integrated into other cultures may conform to local naming practices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Gnome Forenames</h4>\n<p>Gnomes usually name their children following a traditional pattern. The firstborn is named after the grandmother on the mother&rsquo;s side or the grandfather on the father&rsquo;s side. The second born is named after the mother or father. The third is named for the grandmother on the father&rsquo;s side or the grandfather on the mother&rsquo;s side. And the fourth, and later, is named after any other relations of importance. However, it is also common to name children after people important to the family, such as local rulers, those who have been of great service, or close friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Matrilineal Names:</strong> Elowen, Ia, Kerra, Ladoca, Metheven, Morwen, Steren, Tryfena</p>\n<p><strong>Example of Patrilineal Names:</strong> Breward, Daveth, Gwinear, Mawnan, Meriasek, Nivet, Talan, Ythel</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Gnome Clan Names</h4>\n<p>According to Gnome myth, there were originally 444 great clans of Gnomes. The gods created each clan for a specific purpose, which was secretly imparted to the Great Mother of each clan to pass on to her children. Today, few Gnomes believe such fables, but priests and priestesses continue to repeat the old stories, warning the surviving clans that they should never forget their original purposes.</p>\n<p>In Glimdwarrow, only eight clans remain, and most Gnomes in the Reikland hail from one of those eight. A Gnome&rsquo;s clan name is inherited from the mother, and never changes, even when a Gnome marries. Many Gnomes, secretive folk such as they are, prefer to keep their clan name secret, and instead offer an epithet as a surname.</p>\n<p>These names are often descriptive, self-mocking, and sometimes sardonic, such as Mudfoot, Glittereye, Soleheart, or Patchcloak.</p>\n<p><strong>Glimdwarrow Clans:</strong> Annearil, Frayne, Hawken, Landweth, Peddlar, Scantleburn, Thorne, Trethewey&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Physical Details</h3>\n<p>As with all Species, you can either randomly determine the following details or choose from the ranges available.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Age</h4>\n<p>The natural lifespan for Gnomes is around 500 years, though few reach this age. To determine a random starting age, roll 10d10+20.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Eye Colour</h4>\n<p>Gnome eye colour changes as they age, typically starting with brighter colours then gradually turning grey as they grow older. Most Gnomes have entirely grey eyes by their 200th birthday.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 102px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 108px; height: 17px; text-align: center;\"><strong>2d10</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 192px; height: 17px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Eye Colour</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 104px; height: 17px; text-align: center;\"><strong>2d10</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 198px; height: 17px; text-align: center;\"><strong>Eye Colour</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px; text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 108px; height: 17px;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 192px; height: 17px;\">Pale Blue</td>\n<td style=\"width: 104px; height: 17px;\">12-14</td>\n<td style=\"width: 198px; height: 17px;\">Hazel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px; text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 108px; height: 17px;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width: 192px; height: 17px;\">Blue</td>\n<td style=\"width: 104px; height: 17px;\">15-17</td>\n<td style=\"width: 198px; height: 17px;\">Pale Brown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px; text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 108px; height: 17px;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width: 192px; height: 17px;\">Deep Blue</td>\n<td style=\"width: 104px; height: 17px;\">18</td>\n<td style=\"width: 198px; height: 17px;\">Brown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px; text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 108px; height: 17px;\">5-7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 192px; height: 17px;\">Turquoise</td>\n<td style=\"width: 104px; height: 17px;\">19</td>\n<td style=\"width: 198px; height: 17px;\">Dark Brown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px; text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 108px; height: 17px;\">8-11</td>\n<td style=\"width: 192px; height: 17px;\">Pale Green</td>\n<td style=\"width: 104px; height: 17px;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"width: 198px; height: 17px;\">Violet</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Hair Colour</h4>\n<p>Like their eyes, Gnome hair turns grey with age, and eventually turns a deep-silver (not white).

To determine a random height, roll 1d10 + 3&rsquo;4&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3>Sidebar: Gnome Pedlars</h3>\n<p>Gnomes from Clan Peddlar have wandered the Empire&nbsp;for centuries, trading for goods and spying on their&nbsp;neighbours. Indeed, many scholars claim the word &lsquo;pedlar&rsquo;&nbsp;is sourced in that Clan name, and that the dangerous&nbsp;profession was introduced to the Empire by Gnomes.</p>\n<h2>Gnome Gods</h2>\n<p>Gnomes believe their gods created the Gnome species in a time of great need, tasking each clan with a specific purpose. Even though most of these legendary tasks are lost to myth, Gnomes typically have a very close relationship with their gods. Most pray before enacting activities associated with one of their deities, and it is common for Gnomes to make offerings to avoid falling into disfavour with their gods. In general, no god is placed above any other; although, each clan usually favours one god over the others for traditional reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When abroad, Gnomes have no desire to offend the other gods, and often visit local temples and shines to make appropriate offerings, which they feel will make it more likely they will pass through foreign lands safely.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Gnome Priests</h3>\n<p>Gnomes dedicating themselves to the service of the gods, and ensuring their chosen deity is appeased, draw respect from other Gnomes, as they understand just how capricious and difficult the gods can be. Gnomes looking for spiritual guidance in matters directly related to one of the gods will often turn to a priest for advice.</p>\n<p>Gnome Priests use the rules from <strong>WFRP</strong>, Chapter 7, with Blessings and Miracles defined by the <strong>Gnome God</strong>s table, all of which should be reimagined for the each god as appropriate. These rules are fast and simple, and should be expanded as required.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Evawn</h4>\n<p>Evawn is the God of Travel, Trade, and Thievery. She appears as a benign middle-aged Gnome with a high stack of goods piled upon her back, atop which is perched a magpie. Those who follow her ways wander the world, trading their goods for local produce whilst simultaneously stealing anything that may be of use to Gnomekind as a whole.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.62px; font-weight: bold;\">Strictures of Evavm</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>One coin in ten belongs to Evawn.</li>\n<li>By theft or by barter, make a profit every day.</li>\n<li>Never be caught in a lie.</li>\n<li>Never stay in the same location for more than a month.</li>\n<li>Steal items of use to the Gnommi, and take them back&nbsp;to your clan.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Mabyn</h4>\n<p>Mabyn is the Gnome God of Shadows, Revenge, and Magic. She has no permanent form, and is usually depicted only as a grey cloak, silver blade, and pointed, grey hat, which those sworn to her normally wear. She is known for her fanatical devotion to the Gnome race, and her complete lack of what most mortal folk would consider as morals.</p>\n<p>Worship of Mabyn has increased considerably in Glimdwarrow after the devastation wrought upon the burrows there by Grom the Paunch a century ago. She is the primary deity of the Dwarrow Guard.</p>\n<h5>Strictures of Mabyn</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect the Gnome burrows, no matter the cost.</li>\n<li>Always take vengeance for wrongs done to you, your&nbsp;clan, or your burrow.</li>\n<li>Never reveal the locations of your home burrow to outsiders.</li>\n<li>Practice with your sword for at least an hour a day.</li>\n<li>If you seek to be unseen, do not be spotted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Ringil</h4>\n<p>Ringil is the God of Entertainment, Merriment, and Trickery. He is generally portrayed as an impish, elderly jester wearing motley. However, for all his foolish appearance, Ringil is also the patron of spies, subterfuge, and detection, known for slipping into, and out from, any danger in order to gather intelligence to protect his people.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.62px; font-weight: bold;\">Strictures of Ringil</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never deny a reasonable request to entertain others.</li>\n<li>Do not share any secrets outside your clan, cult, or cronies.</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t let a serious moment pass without a gag, a song,or a trick.</li>\n<li>A practical joke is the best revenge.</li>\n<li>Learn a useful secret every week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 102px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 77px; height: 17px;\"><strong>God</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 325px; height: 17px;\"><strong>Evawn</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 333px; height: 17px;\"><strong>Mabyn</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 320px; height: 17px;\"><strong>Ringil</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 77px; height: 17px;\"><strong>Sphere</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 325px; height: 17px;\">Travel, Trade, Thievery</td>\n<td style=\"width: 333px; height: 17px;\">Shadows, Revenge, Magic</td>\n<td style=\"width: 320px; height: 17px;\">Entertainment, Spies, Trickery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 77px; height: 17px;\"><strong>Worshippers</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 325px; height: 17px;\">Merchants, pedlars, thieves</td>\n<td style=\"width: 333px; height: 17px;\">Assassins, wizards, the wronged</td>\n<td style=\"width: 320px; height: 17px;\">Charlatans, entertainers, spies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 77px; height: 17px;\"><strong>Offerings</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 325px; height: 17px;\">Gold, stolen goods, foreign artefacts</td>\n<td style=\"width: 333px; height: 17px;\">Dead enemies of the Gnomes, magic artefacts, swords</td>\n<td style=\"width: 320px; height: 17px;\">Secrets, silver, wine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 77px; height: 17px;\"><strong>Blessings</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 325px; height: 17px;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.NTin0goaE1XqZzte]{Charisma}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.qkn5lkVp3hDoSGKe]{Courage}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.vK1zM8l2c3WyDsvn]{Fortune}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.HP6Oh9RBzwlpeq2G]{Finesse}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.w2SEx2C0PV2b2qR7]{Hardiness}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.RGASiAhCPdNmUVaL]{Protection}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 333px; height: 17px;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.4zmZ9wGeBwnwWnXe]{Battle}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.w2SEx2C0PV2b2qR7]{Hardiness}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.RGASiAhCPdNmUVaL]{Protection}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.aPAJtFmP6ZVD1qLl]{Righteousness}, Tenacity, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.3nRKuLTPo5NReGEE]{Wisdom}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 320px; height: 17px;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.2Yv6XzcgrEULfpTq]{Breath}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.NTin0goaE1XqZzte]{Charisma}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.vNoW9XsR82OopSNi]{Conscience}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.cld3zjQDGcOWZnUq]{Grace}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.9gq4bfNz7PS92ceM]{The Hunt}, @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.pmfgo5jhJhpSc7W6]{Wit}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 77px; height: 17px;\"><strong>Miracles</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 325px; height: 17px;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.I2AYi9wUyO1N9tTv]{An Invitation}; @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.2G9GCVcTdMw7Atut]{Rich Man, Poor Man, Beggar Man, Thief}; @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.tD4UtupfVjtQ8eBg]{Rhya's Shelter}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 333px; height: 17px;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.L9tmaCtqPHy5NFSN]{Death Mask}; @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.1mIGWNhUBhAk5eLY]{You Ain't Seen Me, Right?}; @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.bbiTgus74ycM7Nrn]{Sword of Justice}</td>\n<td style=\"width: 320px; height: 17px;\">@Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.vpp7dJYxpHFjUxXz]{Blind Justice}; @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.MKPjKpfR9VloNC1D]{Leaping Stag}; @Compendium[wfrp4e.prayers.TI3cD8YKR6V45GqP]{Ranald's Grace}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Gnome Corruption</h2>\n<p>Gnomes mutate in the same fashion as Humans (<strong>WFRP</strong>, page 183).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reference</h2>\n<p>Rough Nights &amp; Hard Days, pp 86-90</p>","img":""}
